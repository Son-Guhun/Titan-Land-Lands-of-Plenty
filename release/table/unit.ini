Muradin, reading an inscription, reported that the blade was cursed and pleaded ''Oh, leave it be, Arthas! Forget this business and lead your men home!'', but Arthas was adamant. Arthas asked the spirits of the cavern for the sword to be released from its icy prison, proclaiming that he would ''give anything or pay any price, if only you will let me save my people.'' When the weapon broke free, Muradin was struck by a rogue shard of ice. Arthas moved to help Muradin, but was dissuaded by the call of Frostmourne in his mind. Arthas discarded his holy warhammer, Light's Vengeance, if favour of the vile sword before him."
