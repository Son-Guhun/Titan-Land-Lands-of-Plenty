Some abilities that rely on dummies may get cast multiple times when a dummy is created for neutral hostile
Fix (no performance hit, not possible when multile castings are required): Set dummy ability cooldown (obj editor)
Fix (performance hit, always works): Set ability cooldown (obj editor), use BlzEndUnitAbilityCooldown to reset the cooldown when needed
