Copy this trigger into your map if you want to fix the life drain abilitity. It comes with a potential weird side-effect: if you had already cast a damage over time ability on the damage target from the damage source before life draining, it will heal off of that damage over time ability as well. Without triggering life drain completely on your own, there is no way to prevent this. However, this issue does not affect the Dark Ranger since she only has that one damage-over-time ability.
