AURIEL:
It is through the archangel Auriel that the power of hope flows into the fabric of creation. Her eternal light illuminates even the darkest souls. Seeking harmony in all things, she is a mediator, a counselor, and when the need arises, a fearless warrior.

Al'maiesh, the Cord of Hope, is the chosen weapon of Auriel. The cord is said to be a manifestation of her positive qualities. Pulsing with glowing runes from end to end, the long, serpentine ribbon can heal and energize those it touches. Auriel often draped the cord around Tyrael and Imperius during their many heated arguments, granting them clarity of thought and emotion. 

What makes Auriel unique is her ability to see harmony even in the midst of discord. She believes that victory for one side does not always mean defeat for the other. To her way of thinking, beyond each conflict lies the promise of healing. This philosophy was often exemplified when she acted as a mediator between Tyrael and Imperius, in many of their heated debates. Rather than scolding them or objecting to the use of violence, she let them see that resolution opened the door to new possibilities.
