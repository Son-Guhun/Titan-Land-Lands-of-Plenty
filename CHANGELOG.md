## [v1.4.1] - 2020-01-11

### Added
- New anti-griefing system:
	- Players can only damage units owned by players that are unallied to them.
	- Players can use the **-war** command to allow other players to damage their units, without having to unally them.
- New commands:
	- **-war**
	- **-give all:** Gives all units of the owner of your selected unit to another player. If you are not the titan, you can only use this on your own units. This command replaces the old Mind Titan Power, which is being removed.
	- **-share (player) (player):** The Titan can use this new syntax of the -share command in order to force a player to share their units with another. You cannot use colors with spaces when using this form of the command (so you must use darkgreen instead of dark green, for example).
- New Night Elf Units:
  - Elf
  - Sage
  - Strider
  - Druid Apprentice
  - Veteran Archer
  - Elune's Disciple
  - Spearthrower
  - Druidess
  - Seedmother
  - Grove Archer
  - Autumn Mage
- Added -give all, -freecam and new -share to F9, along with new credit

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that caused generators loaded from old saves to have a "Total Darkness" lighting value by default, instead of "Lordaeron" lighting.
- Fixed an issue that made the Show/Hide ability of Rect Generators  non-functional.
- Fixed a lighting issue with both Mansion Wall decorations.
- Internal changes that may reduce desyncs.
- Waygates and Patrol Points will now be correctly loaded for builts which were requested at a location different from their original. Waygates that were pointing to a location which was outside the saved Rect will still point to that original location.
- Fixed portrait and voice sounds for many Forest Elf units.
- Fixed a small invisible hill in the Titan Palace.

### Changed
- You can now use modification commands on units of player that have shared control with you. This does not apply to forced shares caused by the Titan.
- Renamed Deco Builder Creep to Deco Builder Creeps (to match race selector name).
- Many deco builders now use unique icons, in order to make browser the Deco tents more convenient: Norse, Runes, Huts, Flags, Gurubashi, Celtic, Elves Blood, Runic, Draenei, Webs, Rostrodle, Gravestones, Effects, Ice, Norse, Drow, Elves Forest, Icecrown, Wintergarde, Creeps, Elves Forest, Columns, Flowers, Tableware, S&S (Manor, Kingdom & Shire), Crops, Castle, Gate, Archways, Village, Seats, Games, Floors, Mansion, Walls, Medieval, Ruined, Blocks, Fences, Furniture, Rohan

### Removed
- Removed Power: Mind from the Titan Palace.
- Deprecated -mind command and 'mind command. An error message will show when trying to use them.


## [v1.4.0] - 2020-01-08

### Added
- Save System improvements:
  - Saves made with Rect Generators (-tsav, -dsav, -usav) will now spawn a special Rect Generator when loaded into the game. This Rect Generator can be used to move the save around, so it can be loaded anywhere on the map.
  - If you want to automatically load a Rect save at its original location, use the **-req** instead of **-request**.
- New commands:
  - **-usav:** This command can be used to save all your units inside of a Rect Generator, but not any unit outside of it..
  - **-compat:** This command must be used to load old saves (made between 1.2.1 and 1.3.0) instead of the -request command.
  - **-freecam:** This command allows players to use a new controllable camera. The camera works as a 3rd person camera, but it can be a first person camera by setting zoom to 0.
    - **Hotkeys**:
	  - **WASD:** Moves the camera North/West/South/East
	  - **IJKL:** Rotates the camera.
	  - **SPACE:** Moves the camera up.
	  - **CTRL+SPACE:** Moves the camera down.
	  - **NUMPAD 4 and 6:** Adjusts the speed of movement.
	  - **NUMPAD 2 and 8:** Slightly adjusts the speed of movement.

- **Rect Generators** now have a new ability which allows players to control the environment lighting inside of them. Along with decrations that emit light (such as lanterns), this can be used for better dynamic lighting.
- New animals: Dolphin, Shark and Manta Ray.
- Many commands now accept mathematical expressions. For example, you can type **'fly 2^5** instead of **'fly 32**. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation and modulo (%).
- Riderless Horses and Pack Horses now have a **Pick Up Rider** ability, allowing them to be ridden by a unit.
- New tip/hint for the **-count** command.
- Save Files now have integrity checks. If a file is missing or can not be read, the game will now warn the player. If a single unit's data is corrupted, the game will also warn the player.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue that caused unselectable non-decoration units to be loaded incorrectly.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when converting certain orc spellcasters into heroes.
- Fixed an issue that would cause Ancients to always face the defeault angle when loaded from a save.
- Strange behaviour of inverting a rect's size when making it smaller than minimum size has been removed.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when using Staff of Mimic.
- Fixed a crash that could occur when removing units from the game.
- Fixed an issue where a command could run twice. This was especially harmful when loading saves.
- Fixed an issue that caused abilities to be inaccessible when switching selection using the **-select no** command. This fix may cause unit training for any selected structures to be canceled for the currently trained unit when using this command.
- Fixed hotkeys and tooltips for many units.

### Changed
- Changed commands:
  - **-req:** This command is no longer used to load old saves. Instead, it is used to automatically load saves made with Rect Generators at their original position, instead of choosing a new position.
- Players can now load simultaneously without affecting performance. Players will take turns loading pieces of their saves, which means if two players are loading, they will take twice as long (until one of them finishes loading.)
- Saves will now be located in the folder: **Documents\Warcraft III\CustomMapData\TLLoP\Saves**
- Ancients' rooted/unrooted status is now saved by the Save System.
- Neutral units are now also loaded as neutral units.
- Improved Rect Generator behaviour near map borders:
  - Rect Generator lightning indicators will no longer behave strangely when near a map border.
  - Rect Generator will now remember its old size when leaving a map border.
  - You can now expand a Rect Generator when it is near a map border.
- Vastly improved loading performance:
  - Loading will no longer cause largely disproportionate frame losses for the requesting player.
  - Improved performance when loading terrain.
  - A message is now shown to the loading player when finished.
  - Warnings will now show for corrupted units or files.
- Vastly improved saving perfomance:
  - Players can now save the entire map's terrain and trees without causing the game to freeze for many seconds.
- When setting a save center while selecting a unit, a message will now pop up with the new coords.
- Added colored text to -count command.
- Trees no longer play their birth animation when being created or revived.

### Removed
- The external SaveNLoad program is no longer supported. Old saves from before 1.2.1 can no longer be loaded into the game, and must be converted in a version that supports both systems (1.2.1 to 1.3.5).
- All units that had been deprecated after version 1.3.0 have been removed, which means their IDs may be overwritten by new units. To transfer saves that used this units, they must be loaded and saved in 1.3.5 first.
- The map no longer uses the UnitEvent library. This may avoid crashes when removing a unit from the game.
- Gnoll units in the Titan Palace, and the Fel Shivarra hero, have been removed. This is because they have been implemented into the game and are now trainable.

		- East icy-grass environment.

- Added a helpful description to the Water Square decoration.
- Polished stats for Lizardmen and Ratfolk units.
- Lizardman Juggernaut now starts with 200 mana.

### Removed
- Removed limit system and -limit command for the Titan
- Terrain Editor has been disabled (suspected of causing loading screen crashes).
- Greatly reduced the number of abilities in the map by leveraging the power of the new patch 1.31 instance API added by Blizzard. This should somewhat reduce loading time at the end of the loading bar.


## [v1.2.3] - 2019-08-08

### Fixed
- Horizontal logs will now load correctly, instead of becoming vertical.
- Fixed crashes that would occur when some caster units were converted to heroes.
- Fixed an issue that would cause decorations to lose the *alternate* tag when made unselectable.
- Fixed an issue that made players other than the Titan unable to use the **-makehero** command.
- Fixed a small issue that could cause bugs when two players loaded builds which had the same name.
- Fixed models for:
	- Fleshless Lesser Lich
	- Blood Elf Phoenix Crusader
	- Tree Nordrassil decoration (no longer bugs near transparent models)

### Changed

- Divine Shield has been rebalanced. Duration is now 5 seconds, cooldown is now 15 seconds.
- Made more abilities compatible with the **-ability** command. **Note:** heroes saved in older versions may lose these abilities when being loaded into the map.

	- Cleaving Attack
	- Cluster Rockets
	- Drain Life
	- Drunken Brawler
	- Forked Lightning
	- Frost Arrows
	- Healing Spray
	- Howl of Terror
	- Mana Shield
	- Storm, Earth and Fire
- Standardized tooltip and hotkey for some of the new compatible abilities.


## [v1.2.2] - 2019-07-31

### Fixed
- Arin's and Blood Elf Elite Strider's models are no longer missing.
- Female Blood Elf Lieutenants no longer spawn with size 1000.
- Fixed buff name of Greater Bloodlust.
- Fixed an issue where removing a togglable aura which was active would cause the aura effect to persist on the hero.
- Units converted to heroes with **-makehero** will now maintain their visual values (such as custom name, flying height, rgb color and player color).

### Changed
- The number of abilities that can be added to a hero has been increased from 4 to 7.
- **-makehero** was turned into a player command. Players are now limited to 12 heroic units per player, though the Titan can bypass this limit for any player. *Developer comments: Having the -makehero command as a player command was always the intention, however, a lot of testing had to be done to ensure the command would not cause any issues.*
- Units that were turned into heroes with **-makehero** are now saved and loaded as heroes.
- Heroes are now saved with the abilities they currently possess. When loaded, all their removeable abilities will be removed, and their ability list will be restored. In the future, when new abilities are made removeable, some heroes may be loaded without these new abilities, as they will have become removeable, but would not have been saved along with the hero.
- Rect Generators' terrain fog settings will now be saved and loaded.
- Units that are converted into heroes will no longer be able to cast Mirror Image. Casting this ability used to remove these units.
- Tooltips of Cosmic Essence and Mirror Image have been updated to reflect the fact they don't function with converted heroes.

### Removed
- The First Person Camera documentation has been removed from the F9 manual while the system is not enabled.


## [v1.2.1] - 2019-07-24

### Added
- New version of the Save system. The external SaveNLoad program is no longer required, saving and loading is done entirely using Warcraft III's functionalities. To transfer old saves to the new system, they must be loaded using the new **-req** command. Using SaveNLoad.exe will be required for this. After loading the old save, it can be saved using the save commands and afterwards it can be loaded with the **-request** command.
- Created a new ingame Terrain Editor, that works similarly to the World Editor's Terrain Editor. Currently, it is a very simple tool, but it will be greatly expanded upon in the furute. It will be the most supported form of terrain editing going foward, so try and ditch the Deco Modifier Terrain, if you can.
- New Commands:
	- -collision (on/off): allows you to turn collison on/off for units. This allows naval units to go onto land and ground units to walk through cliffs.
    - -editor (terrain/none): Allows you to enter/exit the new ingame Terrain Editor.
	- -ability (add/remove/clear): Use the new ability system to manipulate which abilities a hero has. Read F9 menu in-game for more details.
	- -fix (darkness/selection): New (probably temporary) command to fix issues some players have been experiecing.
- New Races:
	- Worgen
	- Ratfolk
	- Lizardmen
- New Deco Builders:
	- [Stone & Sword](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/hybrisfactory-terraining-and-mapping-resources.238310/) builders:
		- **Deco Builder S&S Manor 1 and 2:** These are two new deco builders with 89 new decorations in total. These decorations are modular, allowing you to build pretty much any medieval building your imagination can come up with!
		- **Deco Builder S&S Kingdom 1 and 2:** There are two new deco builders that add a total of 54 new decorations. These decorations are pretty useful for creating interiors, villages or markets.
	- **Deco Builder Mushrooms:** Builds mushrooms that used to be built by Deco Builder Crops. Also added new mushrooms:
		- Giant Mushrooms (and Red variations)
		- White Spotted Mushrooms
	- **Deco Builder Tableware:** Builds things that you can put on top of tables.
		- Mug
		- Bread
		- Plate, Plate with Meat
		- Candelabra, Candelabra (Off)
	- **Deco Builder Castle:** Creates interior decorations for castles, including walls (with arches/doors/windows), pillars and banners.
	- **Deco Builder Naga 2:** Contains a few new naga structures.
	- **Deco Builder Gurubashi:** Contains Gurubashi buildings with Sunken Ruins textures made by THW user Ujimasa Hojo.
	- **Deco Builder Huts:** Builds creep huts that used to be located in the Titan's Palace.
- New Decorations:
	- Deco Builder Fire:
		- Flame Grate (round and rectangular)
	- Deco Builder Misc:
		- Magical Pen (can be activated and deactivated)
	- Deco Builder Misc:
		- Animal Spawner 3: Pig, Red Fox, Horses and Belf Wagon (not an animal, but who cares?)
	- Deco Builder Naga:
		- A few new naga structures.
	- Deco Builder Water:
		- New Water Square decoration that uses an HD water model.
- Critters will no longer wander around aimlessly by default. An ability has been added to them which allows the wandering behaviour to be enabled or disabled.
- New Critter: Fox.

#### Minor Additions:
- Cosmosis now possesses the Obliterate spell to remove unselectable decorations.
- Readded the Noldor elven units to a new Barracks that can be built by the High Elf Architect.
- New tips have been added for the ability system and the Terrain Editor.


### Fixed
- Many changes have been made in order to make the map more stable. Desyncs and crashes seems to have been mitigated, though they are not yet completely gone.
- Certain models (such as City Buildings) should no longer become partly invisible when they receive an RGB value. They will still become partly invisible if they receive an alpha value.
- Tooltips for High Elf and Highborne decorations are now correct.
- Ressurection stone has been correctly added to Deco Builder Rocks (it was missing before).
- Dragonspawn Cavern can now be built normally.
- **Possibly** fixed some desyncs that could **possibly** happen at the start of the game. *It's hard to mod Warcraft 3*.
- **Possibly** fixed some desyncs that could **possibly** be caused by the camera system and RectGenerator system. *Really hard*.
- Fixed an issue where sometimes Rect Generators with sides greater than 2048x2048 would not perform correctly.
- Young King's Mount Up ability now has the L hotkey and will no longer conflict with his Charge ability.
- Greater Bloodlust will now work in patch 1.31.
- Giving a unit to neutral will no longer cause it to lose it's custom color (given with the -color command).
- Fixed an issue where the original unit would be given to Red when its mimic died (Staff of Mimic).

### Changed
- The map now requires patch 1.31 or greater.
- The maximum number of players in the map has been reduced to 12, in an attempt to mitigate desyncs. In the future, the limit may be increased to 24 again, if it is found that it was not a cause for desyncs.
- Rect Generators' Toggle Terrain Fog ability is now functional. By default, fogs are disabled.
- The Titan can now make any player's decorations unselectable, in order to avoid lag.
- Terrain:
	- Added a secondary entrance to the Dirt Peaks (connected to the Blighted Lands).
- Decorations will now maintain their flying height when upgraded.
- Load limit increased from 9999 to 2147483647.
- Rect Generators and Animal/Villager Spawners cano no longer be made unselectable.
- Blizzard and Rain of Fire will no longer damage the casting hero. Only applies for the heroic versions of these abilities.
- Drow Dark Hall can now train Deco Builder Drow.

#### Minor Changes:
- Unselectable decorations are now Special Effects instead of units with the Locust ability. This SHOULD increase performance, and in the future it will allow for more flexiblity with unit visuals (negative flying height and rotations along the x and y axes). Even though this is a minor change for the end user, this is the part of the update which took the longest to properly finish.
- Custom heroes created with -makehero will now have the Hero armor type.
- Fire Campfire (with Pig) has been removed from Deco Builder Fire's build menu. It is now an upgrade of Fire Campfire.
- Double quotes (") will be converted to two single quotes ('') when saving unit names.
- Cenarius has had his stats rebalanced, he should now be one of the most tanky Intelligence heroes.
- Made unit sizes more consistent for High Elves and Blood Elves.

### Removed
- Removed glowing mushrooms from the Scorched Lands. This part of the terrain is going to see a massive overhaul, probably in 1.3.0. Removing these mushrooms should reduce FPS lag that some people experience in LoP.
- Removed creep huts from the Titan Palace, since they now have a deco builder.


## [v1.2.0] - 2019-07-24

### Added:

## [v1.1.2] - 2019-05-14

### Added:
- The Goblin Merchant now has many kinds of Orbs in stock.

### Fixed:
- Minor issues that could cause handle reference leaks.

## [v1.1.0] - 2019-05-05

### Added:
- New terrain:
	- Mountainous terrain from the KoT desert has been ported and converted into a canyon.
	- Added rocks to the blighted terrain cliffs to make it more visually appealing.
	- Made desert islands in the northeast connected through shallow water instead of deep water. *Developer comments: In KoT, the most used islands are the ones that are connected by shallow water, since they can also be used as a single, larger, island. This update should make the islands attractive to a larger group of players.*
	- Southwest desert has been completed turned into a lushous forest with many good spots for simple bases.
	- Parts of the Southeast that were not converted into canyon have been converted into desert.
	- Added more trees in the middle forest. *Developer comments: This should make the place feel less empty, and shoul allow for better spots for simple, quickly-built, bases.*
- New commands:
	- -time => Allows the Titan to change the in-game time of day.
	- -rotate => Allows you to set the angle of rotation for the Rotate ability of decorations.
	- -controller => Allows you to spawn a Controller deco (was removed from -decos command in version 1.0.0). This deco allows you to control units and move them using the QoL decoration abilities. All controllers of the same player control the same group of units. To add or remove units from your controller group, use the -control and -uncontrol commands.
	- -roll => Allows players to generate random numbers in certain ranges. You can use a tabletop (2d6) notation or a range notation ((number) (min) (max) => 2 1 6).
- New command arguments:
	- -seln/sele rect => Will now select your Rect Generators.
	- 'mind (number/color) => Will now work as if you had ordered the Power: Mind unit to right-click your selected units.
- Improved -makehero command. 
	- Now simulates an EXP bar.
	- Now gives hero-like stats to the unit.
	- Now shows the unit's main stat in a special item in its inventory. Currently only strength is supported.
- New hero abilities:
	- New unique hero abilities for casters: Arcane Ward, Extraplanar Body, Nature's Wrath. *Developer comment: Intelligence heroes felt a lot weaker then strength and agility heroes. These new abilities should bring them up to the correct power level. Some intelligence heroes that were already pretty strong have not been given these abilities.*
	- Comet: A comet falls down from the sky, dealing damage and stunning enemy units. Ability has a 1-second cast time and a small delay happens before the comet falls. This ability can even stun magic-immune units. Additionally, a successful hit resets the cooldown for other specific hero abilities. 
	- Searing Hatred (Sargeras only): a SFX-intensive ability (as the hero deserves) that makes Sargeras more effective at regaining mana and destroying armies. Inspired by his ability to burn things for miles in the WoW RPG.
	- Energy Surge: Similar to Power Surge, but with a lower cooldown while restoring a smaller amount of mana. Also restores hit points.

	- Gray Elves

	- Deco Builder Gates:
		- Ruins Gates (including diagonal and massive)
		- Diagonal Gates (Normal, Dungeon and Demon gates)
		- Iron Gates (including diagonal)
		- Castle Iron Gate (diagonal only)
		- Wooden Gate
	- Deco Builder Archways:
		- Wooden Archway (3 variations)
	- Deco Builder Water:
		- Sunwell (upgrades from the fountain)
	- Deco Builder City 3:
		- Ironforge exterior structures (includes gate and 9 other variations)

	- **Diamond of Mass Teleportation**: Allows a hero to use the Archmage's ultimate ability: Mass Teleportation.

### Fixed
- A hostile 'Give Unit To' circle is no longer created at coordinates (0, 0).
- -control/uncontrol commands are now easier to use again, since you can more easily spawn a Controller deco.
- Non-decoration structures loaded with a flying height will no longer keep the Enable/Disable Flight ability.
- Adding animation tags to units that have animation tags by default (like Castles or Guard Towers) with the -tag command now works correctly. These units are now also correctly loaded with the Save System.
- All decorations now have the L hotkey instead of the F hotkey. This avoids any hotkey conflicts with decoration QoL abilities.
- Some hero abilities no longer deal double damage. To compensate, Carrion Burst and Will of the Tribunal have been buffed.
- Angel of Creation can no longer be loaded into the game.
- Removing a unit from the game no longer causes a small lag spike.
- Fixed an issue when saving terrain that would save all tiles as grass.

### Changed
- Structures can now have their flying height set with commands. Decorations will automatically cast Enable Flight when their flying height is changed.
- Dark Summoning (from the item in the Titan Teleportation Solutions shop) no longer clusters units.
- Heroes no longer have to learn default wc3 hero abilities. All heroes spawn with their hero abilities automatically learned.
- Overhauled hotkeys for hero abilties. Ability hotkeys are not separated by their targeting type (target, point, circle), functionality (instant, buff, debuff) and casting form (instant, channeled, delayed). Hero abilities now consistenly show their hotkey between brackets after the ability name. Hopefully this will make it so creating heroes is more streamlined and allow for more fun to use heroes.
- Added many custom icons for abilities. *Developer comments: while I personally am against adding icons, I can understant that they add value to many users, and can help immersion. To this crowd, I consider that the most valuable icons to add would be ability and hero icons. For now, only ability icons will be added, and only to avoid icon conflicts for generic abilities. For unique hero abilities (such as Tyral's WotT), the icons shall either be already imported for other custom abilities or default wc3 icons.*
- Improved icons for many decorations and units. Imported custom icons for hero attributes (mainly for the -makehero command).
- Changed Sargeras's animation names to make more animations available. Check out his tooltip!
- Artillery units can no longer become heroes.
- Improved decoration rotate by angle ability tooltip (in light of the new *-rotate* command).

### Removed
- Removed vertical versions of gates that had a horizontal and vertical version. They have been replaced by the diagonal version of the gate.
